        <h1>Guilds </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Guilds or also refered as "servers" are the main thing besides direct messages and phone calls. So the API for it is pretty huge.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Guild Object</h2>
        <p>The Guild object is a key class for every Program, so let's learn how to create one!</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
use \Discord\Objects\Guild;

$guildid = "THE_ID_OF_YOUR_DESIRED_GUILD";
$token_type = "Bot" // In most cases you want to use Bot, learn more about scopes here;
$token = "THE_BOT_TOKEN"; // get it at discord.gg/developers/@me/myapps
$guild = new Guild($guilid, $token_type, $token);
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <p> Okay, now let's have a look at the Methods you can access. Spoiler: there are a lot. And some even contain more objects and more.
        <pre><code class="language-php">
$guild->getId();
@return ID of guild
@returntype snowflake
        </code></pre>
